''' 
The method title() appears after the variable in the print() call.
The method is action that Python can perform on a piece of data. 
The dot (.) tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name.
Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because methods often need
additional information to de hteir work.
That inofrmation is provided inside the parentheses.
The title() function doesn't need any additional information, so its parentheses are empty.
